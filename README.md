# ‚úàÔ∏è Real-Time Flight Status Update System

**Welcome to the Real-Time Flight Status Update System project!** This innovative platform is designed to keep passengers informed about their flights by providing real-time updates. The system delivers crucial information, such as delays, cancellations, and gate changes, directly to passengers through various channels like SMS, email, and app notifications. By integrating with airport systems and using advanced technologies, the goal is to enhance the travel experience by ensuring passengers have the most accurate and timely information.

## üöÄ Features

### üïí Real-time Updates
- **Current Flight Status:** The system provides up-to-the-minute information on flight status, including delays, cancellations, and gate changes, ensuring passengers are always aware of any changes.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** The user interface is designed with React.js to offer an intuitive and responsive experience, allowing passengers to easily access all relevant flight details.

### üì≤ Push Notifications
- **Stay Informed:** Firebase Cloud Messaging and RabbitMQ are used to send real-time notifications, ensuring passengers receive instant alerts via their preferred communication channels, such as SMS, email, or in-app notifications.
- **Flexible Notification Channels:** Passengers can choose how they receive updates, whether through text messages, emails, or app alerts.

### üåê Integration with Airport Systems
- **Accurate Data:** The system pulls data from airport databases to provide the most accurate and up-to-date flight information. During development and testing phases, mock data is used to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring reliability and performance.
- **Seamless Integration:** The backend, developed using Python, interacts with various data sources to aggregate and process information efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js:** Utilized for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **CSS3:** For crafting a responsive and modern UI.

### Backend
- **Python:** The system's backend is built using Python, providing a robust and versatile foundation for data processing and integration.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL:** This relational database is used to store flight information and user preferences securely and efficiently, allowing for quick data retrieval and robust data management.

### Notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging & RabbitMQ:** These technologies ensure that notifications are delivered reliably and promptly, regardless of the communication channel chosen by the user.

## üöß Getting Started
